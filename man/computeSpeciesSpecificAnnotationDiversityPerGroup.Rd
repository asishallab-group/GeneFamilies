\title{Computes the annotation (function) based Shannon Entropy per gene group
separate for each species. Note it is highly recommended to set
\code{options(mc.cores=detectCores())}}
\usage{
computeSpeciesSpecificAnnotationDiversityPerGroup(groups.df,
  group.col = "Tandem.Cluster", species.col = "Species",
  gene.col = "Gene", group.ids = unique(groups.df[, group.col]),
  species = unique(groups.df[, species.col]), gene.annos.arg = all.ipr,
  annos.gene.col = 1, annos.anno.col = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{groups.df}{An instance of base::data.frame with at least three
columns. One must hold the gene group identifiers, another the species
names, and another the gene identifiers (accessions) belonging to the
respective group and species.}

\item{group.col}{The column name of 'groups.df' in which to find the gene
group identifiers. Default is 'Tandem.Cluster'}

\item{species.col}{The column name of 'groups.df' in which to find the
species names. Must intersect with 'species' argument. Default is 'Species'.}

\item{gene.col}{The column name of 'groups.df' in which to find the
gene identifiers (accessions). Default is 'Gene'.}

\item{group.ids}{all group identifiers for which to compute the species
specific annotation based Shannon Entropy. Default is all distinct gene
groups found in 'groups.df'.}

\item{species}{a character vector of species names present in 'groups.df'
'species.col'. Species not present in this argument will not be considered.
Default is all distinct species names found in 'groups.df'.}

\item{annos.gene.col}{the column of 'gene.annos' in which to lookup the gene
identifiers or gene accessions. Default is 1}

\item{annos.anno.col}{the column of 'gene.annos' in which to lookup the
function annotation for the genes in 'gene.accs'. Default is 2}

\item{gene.annos}{The data.frame holding the annotations for the genes in
'gene.accs'. Default is all available InterPro annotations expected to be
found in 'all.ipr'}
}
\value{
An instance of base::data.frame with several columns. The first
holds the gene group identifiers obtained from 'groups.df' and one numeric
column for each species found in 'species'. The later columns hold the
species specific annotation entropies for the respective gene groups; NA
values where no genes of that species were found to be members of the
respective gene group.
