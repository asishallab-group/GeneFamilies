\title{Compute Shannon Entropy as a measure of annotation (function) diversity
within a given set of genes. If gene(s) have multiple annotations these are
sorted and concatonated in order to treat them as single composite
annotations. This means, that e.g if all genes have the same three
annotations the resulting entropy will be 0.}
\usage{
annotationBasedShannonEntropy(gene.accs, gene.annos = all.ipr, gene.col = 1,
  anno.col = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene.accs}{The identifiers or accessions of the genes to compute the
entropy for}

\item{gene.annos}{The data.frame holding the annotations for the genes in
'gene.accs'. Default is all available InterPro annotations expected to be
found in 'all.ipr'}

\item{gene.col}{the column of 'gene.annos' in which to lookup the gene
identifiers or gene accessions. Default is 1}

\item{anno.col}{the column of 'gene.annos' in which to lookup the function
annotation for the genes in 'gene.accs'. Default is 2}
}
\value{
A list with two entries: 'entropy' is the computed shannon entropy,
and 'gene.annos.freqs' is an instance of table showing the annotation
architectures and their frequencies
