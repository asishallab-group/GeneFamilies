\title{Calculates Reads Per Kilobase Million (RPKM)
RPKM = (Rg * 10^9) / (T * Lg)
where
Rg: number of reads mapped to a particular transcript g = count
T = total number of transcripts sampled in run
Lg: length of transcript g (bases) 
Note, that because we use gene length in bases and not in kilobases the
scaling factor is 10^9 and not 10^6.}
\usage{
transcriptsPerKilobaseMillion(raw.count.tbl, gene.col = "gene",
  gene.length.col = "gene.length",
  replicate.cols = setdiff(colnames(raw.count.tbl), c(gene.col,
  gene.length.col)))
}
\arguments{
\item{raw.count.tbl}{A data.frame with at least three columns: One must
contain gene IDs (accessions), another the genes' lengths, and the other
columns are expected to hold the read counts.}

\item{gene.col}{The column name or number in which to find the gene
identifier (accessions). Default is 'gene'.}

\item{gene.length.col}{The column name or number in which to find the gene
lengths. Default is 'gene.length'.}

\item{replicate.cols}{The names or numbers of the columns in which to find
the raw read counts. Default is \code{setdiff(colnames(raw.count.tbl),
c(gene.col, gene.length.col))}}
}
\value{
An extended version of \code{raw.count.tbl} with added columns of
the RPKM values, one column for each column of raw reads in argument
\code{replicate.cols}.
}
