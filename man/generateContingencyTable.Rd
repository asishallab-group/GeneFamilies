\title{Generates a matrix that can directly be used as input for hypothesis
testing, e.g. with base::fisher.test(...). Validates the resulting table
based on the input data. Validation checks whether the intersections of
elements having attribute A and B and those having attribute A and NOT B
truly form the whole set of all elements with attribute A. The same
validation is done for the other rows and columns. Error-Codes are:
1 - row.1 does not fully separate into col.1 and col.2
2 - row.2 does not fully separate into col.1 and col.2
3 - col.1 does not fully separate into row.1 and row.2
4 - col.2 does not fully separate into row.1 and row.2
5 - the sum of all cells sizes in the contingency table is not identical to
the size of the mathematical set of all elements contained in both rows and
columns (row.1, row.2, col.1, col.2).}
